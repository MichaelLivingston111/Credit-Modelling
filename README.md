# Financial-Risk-Modelling

A series of files and machine learning models relating to financial risk assesment. This repository aims to use machine learning techniques to optimize risk assesment on a variety of issues, including: 

_Individual credit risk assesment: Random forest, K-nearest neighbours, deep neural network and logistic regression algorithms._

_Probability of bankruptcy in companies: Dense neural network, estimates bankruptcy with a 92% accuracy (35-40% on true positives, >97% on true negatives)._
